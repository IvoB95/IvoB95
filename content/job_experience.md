place: "iO Eindhoven"\
timespan: "2021 - present"\
iO is a blended agency mainly based in the Netherlands and Belgium. At iO I worked as software engineer within a 'team as a service' for the following organisations.
### NN Belgium
At NN Belgium I worked on a multi channel API platform, which provides generic APIs for business processes and data (which are mostly related to life insurances) for both internal and external parties. I also worked on orchestration components, which implement asynchronous business processes concerning multiple back-office systems.

At NN Belgium I performed the following activities:
- Implementing new features (within a team),
- Communicating with business analysts, functional analysts, and solution architects,
- Knowledge sharing with internal trainees.

At NN Belgium I worked with the following technologies and standards:
- Java together with the Quarkus framework, with which most of the API components are build,
- Microsoft Azure Functions, of which we used the Durable Function feature to build orchestrations,
- Typescript (Node.js), in which the aforementioned Azure Function orchestrations are written,
- other Microsoft Azure components used to support our services, like Azure API Management and Azure Service Bus,
- OpenAPI, which we use to specify our Web APIs,
- AsyncAPI, which we use to specify our asynchronous events.
### Worldline
At Worldline I worked on an e-payment platform called Connect. Connect integrates with multiple payment engines, unifying them under a single API. This makes all payment products of these different payment engines available for all consumers (merchants) of Connect.

Our team's task was to integrate Connect with an existing payment engine previously developed within Worldline. During the development I mainly worked with Java and Spring framework, as these were the technologies used to build Connect.
